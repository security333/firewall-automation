Steps to Use the Script:
Modify the Variables:

Replace the placeholders like network-1-id, mykey, and ubuntu-20.04 with actual values from your OpenStack environment. You can obtain these by running OpenStack CLI commands like openstack network list, openstack flavor list, and openstack image list.
Source OpenStack Credentials:

Make sure that you have sourced your OpenStack credentials using the following command to load the environment variables:
bash
Copy code
source openrc.sh
Make the Script Executable:

Save the script as create_vm_with_4_networks.sh and make it executable by running:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x create_vm_with_4_networks.sh
Run the Script:

Run the script to create the VM and associate a floating IP:
bash
Copy code
./create_vm_with_4_networks.sh
How the Script Works:
OpenStack Commands:

The openstack server create command is used to create a virtual machine (VM). It specifies the flavor, image, security group, key pair, and 4 network interfaces (with --nic for each network).
The openstack floating ip create and openstack server add floating ip commands are used to allocate and associate a floating IP to give the VM external access.
Environment Variables:

The script checks if the OpenStack credentials (OS_AUTH_URL, OS_PROJECT_NAME, etc.) are sourced to avoid errors. If not, it exits with an error message.
Summary:
This script automates the creation of a VM with 4 network interfaces in OpenStack and assigns a floating IP for external access.
Modify the variables according to your OpenStack environment (networks, flavors, images).
Make sure OpenStack CLI and credentials are set up before running the script.
By running this script, youâ€™ll quickly create a VM with the desired configuration in your OpenStack environment without manually issuing multiple commands.
